- This bot is a port of the original Bad Word Blocker on Discord.
- Unless stated, you can safely assume that all commands are restricted to moderators only. Moderators are defined as those with a moderator role, which you can manage with the ``b-mod`` command.
- Like the Disord version of this bot, the goal is to be a free, simple alternative to some of the paid automod bots. Who likes spending money? I know I don't.
